The taxi price from Fiumicino to the centre of Rome is 48€ all included (people, baggages and night run), it’s written on the outside door of every taxi. From Ciampino the last bus is at midnight about (look at the web site of Aeroporti di Roma, www . adr . it to see the updated timetable). The taxi price from Ciampino airport is 30€ all included (people, baggages and night run).You can send me a message (Airbnb and/or whatsapp) when you leave the airport (by bus, taxi, train) so I can know when you will arrive at home and I will be at home waiting for you.IF YOU NEED A LATE CHECK-OUT:The check-out hour is at 11h00. If you leave late on the depart day, there’s no problem. You prepare your baggages and you put them in the entrance (next the main door of my house and next the coffee machine). You have the keys of the house and you can come back when you want to take your baggages (but you can’t enter in the room again). Just remember (IMPORTANT!!!) to leave the keys (for instance in the drawer of the table at the entrance or next the coffee machine) when you leave last time. TO THE AIRPORTS (CIAMPINO AND FIUMICINO) I advice to book by web. Go on the site of Aeroporti di Roma (ADR IT) which lists the timetables of bus departing from Termini. It' s advisable to book (4-6€) and you must PRINT the booking. Or you can go directly to the place of departure of the bus in Via Marsala and Via Giolitti.

Nearby bus in each direction. Parking is difficult and subject to charges.

Buses connect the Esquilino to Colosseum, Piazza Venezia, Piazza Navona, Termini, Pigneto discrict, San Lorenzo disctrict, San Giovanni in Laterano, etc..Let's talk together! I advise you to walk in areas less traveled by tourists, who are not always on the rails: make the rounds of the Tiberina Island and a walk on the banks of the Tiber, lose yourself in the narrow streets of Rome, also visit lesser-known areas and squares: Piazza Margana , Via del Pellegrino, the Jewish Ghetto, the part next to Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, the Pigneto and San Lorenzo discricts, St. Agnes and St. Constance, Santo Stefano Rotondo, the gardens of the Capitol, and so on. Let's Talk!Other things to noteAIR CONDITIONING: Available in July and August and when the outside temperature is very high.Registration numberIT058091C2W9664DMH","Guest favorite","4.9","4.9","4.9","4.9","Guest favorite","4.8","4.8",442,"$80","$42","$75","$516",41.89214,12.50296
