Ideal for a quiet, quality getaway or a base to explore the Eastern Highlands.The spaceBefore we start, here are 4 THINGS PEOPLE LOVE about the Ruby-Hornbill Cottage:1 – It’s all about the VIEW. As you can see from the pictures of the listing, whether you’re having sundowners from the wrap-around veranda or watching the famous Vumba mists from the PRIVATE OUTDOOR SHOWER, the Ruby Hornbill Cottage has unparalleled views of the surrounding Vumba Mountains and Mozambican valleys below.2 – The property is FULLY SOLAR POWERED. If power cuts are getting you down, escape to our off-grid haven. We offer a solar geyser for hot water, a gas stove/oven, and solar for all the lights, fridge, and power needs. 3 – Forget about dated DÉCOR. Our cottage has been recently renovated and has a lot of character. Once a working greenhouse, the cottage has been converted into a bright, open-plan space and is tastefully decorated featuring original creations from Zimbabwean artisans. The elevated sleeping loft (with a queen size bed) offers a unique way to take in the sunrise, while you can stargaze from the studio lounge below-- it features an L-shaped sofa that converts into a deluxe queen size bed. The vintage woodburning stove is perfect for cozy winter’s evenings.4 – The COFFEE TERRACES and mature garden that surround the cottage are magical. It’s the perfect excuse to spend time outdoors with family and friends any time of the year. You may even spot a silvery-cheeked hornbill or some of our other resident wildlife. Take advantage of the POOL and gazebo area, relax in the loungers, or have an evening by the firepit/braai. When the wind is right, we highly recommend flying kites on the front lawn. The cottage is equipped with a TV and media library (movies, series, music). We encourage you to ""unplug"" during your stay, but it may be possible to access internet by phone at certain points in the property.
